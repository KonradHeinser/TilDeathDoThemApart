Got your pawns to finally do more than just tolerate each other? Want them to stop randomly divorcing each other? With this mod, even arguments and accidental bullet wounds won't break these pawns apart, because their marriage is the best thing that has happened in their life. Not exactly a complement considering their current life, but those are just pesky details.

This is an extremely simplistic mod that just sets the relationship bonus for a spouse to be 200 instead of 30, and should be compatable with almost any other mod.
